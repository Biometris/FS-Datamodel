  description: >-
    The proportion of a population who cannot afford the least cost set of food items by food group that would meet requirements for food-based dietary guidelines. The food budget threshold is defined as 52% of household income, based on the average share of income that households in low-income countries spend on food.

  description: >-
    The share of population at higher risk to be affected by food insecurity. The indicator is assessed through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). The FIES is an experience-based food security scale used to produce a measure of access to food at different levels of severity that can be compared across contexts. It includes a set of eight questions asking respondents to self-report conditions and experiences typically associated with limited access to food.

- id: FarmersIncomeRelative
  name: Farmers income in agriculture compared to wages in the rest of the economy
  description: >-
    This indicator compares the wages in the agricultural sector to the rest of the economy. It measures the Agricultural entrepreneurial income (net agricultural entrepreneurial income in real terms) derived from agricultural activities that can be used for the remuneration of own production factors, i.e. non-salaried (= family) labour, land belonging to the agricultural holding and own capital, per unpaid (non-salaried) annual work unit. It is obtained by deducting compensation of employees, rent and net interest from agricultural factor income. For the purpose of this indicator, compensation of employees are added back in, so that the resulting indicator represents the compensation of all work (salaried and non-salaried) performed in the agricultural sector, as well as the income remaining with the enterprise.

  name: 'Water exploitation index, plus (WEI+)'
  description: >-
    Water use in agriculture assessed with the Water Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+), which provides an estimated measure of the total water use as a percentage of the renewable freshwater resources (groundwater and surface water) for a given territory and time period. It helps track the efficiency of water utilization in agricultural practices. As advanced version of the WEI, the WEI+ addresses regional and seasonal aspects of water scarcity. In addition, it also takes water use (water abstraction minus water returned) into account. It identifies areas prone to water stress due to exceeding water abstraction and use on a seasonal scale in relation to the resources available.

- id: GrossNutrientBalanceNitrogen
  name: Gross nutrient balance - nitrogen
  description: >-
    Nitrogen is added to the soil by mineral and organic fertilisers, grazing animals, atmospheric deposition and biological nitrogen fixation, while harvesting of crops, grazing and removal of residues remove nitrogen from the soil. A lack of nitrogen may cause degradation in soil fertility and erosion, while an excess may cause surface and groundwater (including drinking water) pollution and eutrophication. This indicator also helps identifying the factors which contribute to the nitrogen surplus and shows the change over time.

    The indicator is calculated by adding together the quantities of active substances (categorised into Group 3 of Directive 2009/128/EC). These substances are approved as candidates for substitution in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, which are placed on the market in plant protection products each year reported under Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009.

  description: >-
    	The sales of antimicrobials expressed as milligrams (mg) of active substance sold per population correction unit (PCU) â€” mg/PCU. The PCU is applied as a proxy for the size of the food producing animal population (including all horses and excluding companion animals) and serves to normalise the sales data by the number of animals that could be potentially treated with antibiotics in each country. For food-producing animals, the proposed indicators for antimicrobial consumption are: overall sales of veterinary antimicrobials; sales of 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins; sales of quinolones (specifying the proportion of fluoroquinolones); and sales of polymyxins, all measured in milligrams per population correction unit (mg/PCU.) The European Medicines Agency, in frame of the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption project regularly collects data on how antimicrobial medicines are used in animals across the EU.
