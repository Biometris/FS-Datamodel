    EDGAR-FOOD has been developed to aid the understanding of the activities
    underlying the energy demand and use, agriculture and land use change
    emissions associated with the production, distribution, consumption and
    disposal of food through the various stages and sectors of the composite
    global food system. These data were complemented with data from the FAOSTAT
    database on GHG emissions from land use related to agriculture (FAO, 2020).
    Details regarding the methodology applied are available in Crippa et al.

    all possible degrees of temporal and spatial granularity levels (which were
    the main gaps identified in the first phase of the project). Uncertainties
    are also estimated, which are an extra advantage of this indicator in
    comparison with the others included in the F2F monitoring framework.

    Reducing the use and risk of chemical pesticides is an important step
    towards achieving a more sustainable and healthy food system in the EU. It
    is essential to promote sustainable agriculture and protect the environment.
    Pesticides can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to negative impacts
    on ecosystems, such as the loss of biodiversity and the decline of
    pollinators. Pesticides can also have harmful effects on human health,
    particularly for farmers and agricultural workers who handle these
    chemicals. Furthermore, reducing pesticide use and risk can help to promote
    more sustainable farming practices. Alternative approaches, such as
    integrated pest management and agroecology, can reduce the reliance on
    pesticides and promote more sustainable and resilient food systems.

    This indicator informs on the quality of food environments and access to
    healthy diets in the population. It is relevant to several SDGs,
    particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being),
    which emphasize the need for universal access to safe, nutritious, and
    sufficient food. The indicator is often use by International Organizations,
    such as FAO, to determine the percentage of countries' populations that
    cannot afford a healthy diet. High values indicate widespread food
    insecurity and have various adverse implications.

  description: >-
    The indicator monitors the share of population at higher risk to be affected
    by food insecurity. The indicator is assessed and regularly updated by FAO
    through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) in
    more than 140 countries worldwide. The FIES is an experience-based food
    security scale used to produce a measure of access to food at different
    levels of severity that can be compared across contexts. It includes a set
    of eight questions asking respondents to self-report conditions and
    experiences typically associated with limited access to food.
  key_area: Social
  thematic_area: NutritionAndHealth
  indicator_domain: FoodSecurity
  justification: >-
    Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated with
    the inability to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. Food insecurity at
    moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of
    diet-related health conditions in the population, associated with
    micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels of food
    insecurity imply a high probability of inadequate food intake and therefore
    can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger. Food
    insecurity is tied to the quality of food environments. Monitoring the
    prevalence of food insecurity is pivotal for tracking progress towards SDG 2
    aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and
    promote sustainable agriculture. Ensuring sustainable food systems and
    improving food security is also part of the broader objective of the
    European Green Deal to create a fair, healthy, and environmentally-friendly
    food system.

  description: >-
    This indicator compares the wages in the agricultural sector to the rest of
    the economy. It is based on data from the economic accounts for agriculture
    provided by Eurostat for the agricultural sector of the EU as a whole and of
    individual Member States. It measures the Agricultural entrepreneurial
    income (net agricultural entrepreneurial income in real terms) derived from
    agricultural activities that can be used for the remuneration of own
    production factors, i.e. non-salaried (= family) labour, land belonging to
    the agricultural holding and own capital, per unpaid (non-salaried) annual
    work unit. It is obtained by deducting compensation of employees, rent and
    net interest from agricultural factor income. For the purpose of this
    indicator, compensation of employees are added back in, so that the
    resulting indicator represents the compensation of all work (salaried and
    non-salaried) performed in the agricultural sector, as well as the income
    remaining with the enterprise.

    The gap between agricultural and non-agricultural income remains high.
    Therefore, the Common Agricultural Policy and other strategic policies aim
    at reducing these income disparities along the food chain, focusing on
    farmers in particular. A positive share is desirable as it bring make
    farmers' wages closer to those of other workers.

  description: >-
    Water use in agriculture is assessed with the WATER EXPLOITATION INDEX PLUS
    (WEI+), which provides an estimated measure of the total water use as a
    percentage of the renewable freshwater resources (groundwater and surface
    water) for a given territory and time period. It helps track the efficiency
    of water utilization in agricultural practices. As advanced version of the
    WEI, the WEI+ addresses regional and seasonal aspects of water scarcity. In
    addition, it also takes water use (water abstraction minus water returned)
    into account. It identifies areas prone to water stress due to exceeding
    water abstraction and use on a seasonal scale in relation to the resources
    available.
  key_area: Environmental
  thematic_area: SustainableUseOfResources
  indicator_domain: Water
  justification: >-
    Agriculture is a significant consumer of water resources in the EU due to
    irrigation needs for crop production. According to the European Environment
    Agency, agriculture alone accounted for approximately 1/4 of total water
    abstraction in the EU in 2015. This indicator is part of the Performance
    Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Efficient water use in agriculture also contributes to achieving the Green
    Deal’s overarching goals. By promoting sustainable practices, improving
    irrigation systems, and enhancing soil moisture management, water waste can
    be reduced, food security enhanced and food systems more sustainable and
    resilient. Decreasing water consumption in agriculture is envisaged to
    ensure sustainable water management and alleviating water scarcity. Thus, a
    negative direction is desirable.

    Nitrogen is added to the soil by mineral and organic fertilisers, grazing
    animals, atmospheric deposition and biological nitrogen fixation, while
    harvesting of crops, grazing and removal of residues remove nitrogen from
    the soil. A lack of nitrogen may cause degradation in soil fertility and
    erosion, while an excess may cause surface and groundwater (including
    drinking water) pollution and eutrophication. This indicator also helps
    identifying the factors which contribute to the nitrogen surplus and shows
    the change over time.

    The Gross Nutrient Balance illustrates the link between the use of
    agricultural nutrients and the environmental impact, particularly regarding
    potential threats to water quality.  It identifies the factors determining
    the nutrients surplus or deficit and the trends over time. The indicator is
    also part of the Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the
    Common Agricultural Policy. A decreasing trend of Nitrogen Gross Nutrient
    Balance is desirable because it indicates a reduction in the surplus of
    nitrogen in agricultural systems. This is important for reducing nitrogen
    runoff into water bodies, which can lead to eutrophication, and consequent
    negative implications to aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, managing nitrogen
    more efficiently reduces the emission of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse
    gas, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.

    The indicator is part of the EU Sustainable Development Goals indicator set. The 
    trend in the use of more hazardous pesticides is measured with data on the quantities
    of more hazardous active substances, the so called 'candidates for substitution' 
    (categorised into Group 3 of Directive 2009/128/EC), contained in the pesticides 
    which are placed on the market (sold), and therefore used, in each MS. In the context
    of the Biodiversity Strategy, more hazardous pesticides are plant protection products
    containing one or more active substances approved as candidates for substitution
    in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and listed in Part E of
    the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, or containing one or
    more active substances listed in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)
    2015/408. Hence, this indicator serves as a proxy for assessing the growth of healthy
    crop by encouraging natural pest control mechanisms and reducing or minimising risks
    to human health and the environment. Thus, a negative direction is desirable.

    Nitrate pollution is measured by current values and trends in nitrate concentrations 
    in groundwater and rivers, expressed in mg NO3/l for groundwater and mg N/l for rivers. 
    According to the Drinking Water Directive, a maximum concentration of 50 mg/L of nitrate
    in groundwater that is used for drinking water is allowed to avoid threats to human health.
    This indicator refers to concentrations of nitrate (NO3) in groundwater, measured as 
    milligrams per litre (mg NO3/L). Data are taken from well samples and aggregated to annual
    average values. Nitrate can persist in groundwater for a long time and accumulate at a high
    level through inputs from anthropogenic sources (mainly agriculture). Only complete series
    after inter/extrapolation are presented. For details on the total of measuring stations and
    their distribution over the countries, please consult the metadata file.

    Protection of water resources, water ecosystems and of drinking and bathing water is at the
    cornerstone of EU environmental policy. The European Green Deal, with its initiatives of 
    Biodiversity strategies and Zero pollution action plan, set a goal for the EU to reduce 
    nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil 
    fertility. The proposed 8th Environment Action Programme sets the environmental policy 
    agenda for the years from 2021 to 2030 and explicitly mentions water-related issues in two
    of its six priority objectives. This indicator is also part of the Performance Monitoring 
    and Evaluation Framework of the CAP and a set of indicators for the EU Sustainable 
    Development Goals, where it is used to monitor progress towards SDG 6 on clean water and 
    sanitation and SDG 2 on ending hunger and malnutrition. Negative direction for this

      excluding companion animals) and serves to normalise the sales data by the number of 
      animals that could be potentially treated with antibiotics in each country. For 
      food-producing animals, the proposed indicators for antimicrobial consumption are: 
      overall sales of veterinary antimicrobials; sales of 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins; 
      sales of quinolones (specifying the proportion of fluoroquinolones); and sales of polymyxins,
