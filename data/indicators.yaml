  name: Agricultural real factor income per annual work unit (AWU) (sdg_02_20)
  description: Agricultural real factor income measures the income generated by farming, which is used to remunerate borrowed or rented factors of production (capital, wages and land rents) as well as own production factors (own labour, capital and land). Annual work units (AWUs) are defined as full-time equivalent employment (corresponding to the number of full-time equivalent jobs), which is calculated by dividing total hours worked by the average annual number of hours worked in full-time jobs within the economic territory. This can be interpreted as a measure of labour productivity in agriculture. The data stem from the Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA), which provide detailed information on agricultural sector income.

  description: Share of average wage in whole economy; Agricultural entrepreneurial income measures the income derived from agricultural activities that can be used for the remuneration of own production factors, i.e. non-salaried (= family) labour, land belonging to the agricultural holding and own capital. The agricultural income aggregates do not represent the disposable income of farm households, because the latter, in addition to their purely agricultural incomes, may also have income from other sources (non-agricultural activities, remuneration, social benefits, income from property). Comparing agricultural income to average wages in the economy nonetheless provides an estimate for the opportunity cost of agricultural family labour, i.e., the average income opportunities that a person would have outside of agriculture. The Agricultural entrepreneurial income can be negative (in SK e.g.). In this case the share is not calculated. (https://agridata.ec.europa.eu/Qlik_Downloads/Jobs-Growth-sources.htm)

It is a measure of economic activity and is also used as a proxy for the development in a country's material living standards. However, it is a limited measure of economic welfare. For example, neither does GDP include most unpaid household work nor does GDP take account of negative effects of economic activity, like environmental degradation.

It is defined as the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption. GVA is valued at basic prices and intermediate consumption is valued at purchasers'' prices. Justification of selection: GVA provides valuable insights into the sector''s sustainability and alignment with green economy objectives, making it a crucial metric for driving sustainable practices and policies. In general, growing value added can indicate higher productivity and efficiency of production. Currently, we can only show data for the primary sectors and the food processing sectors. Other sectors will be incorporated in the future. With a complete dataset, this indicator can provide valuable insights on the share of value added that is captured at each step of the supply chain. Monitored over time, it can assess progress towards the transition to a sustainable food system.'

Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are indicators of price level differences across countries. PPPs tell us how many currency units a given quantity of goods and services costs in different countries. PPPs can thus be used as currency conversion rates to convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS), eliminating the effect of price level differences across countries. The main use of PPPs is to convert national accounts aggregates into comparable volume aggregates. Applying nominal exchange rates in this process would overestimate the disposable income of countries with high price levels relative to countries with low price levels. The use of PPPs ensures that the adjusted disposable of all countries is valued at a uniform price level and thus reflects only differences in the actual volume of the economy. -> From "Reference metadata": https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tec00113_esmsip2.htm'

  description: Adjusted net national income complements gross national income (GNI) in assessing economic progress (Hamilton and Ley 2010) by providing a broader measure of national income that accounts for the depletion of natural resources. Adjusted net national income is calculated by subtracting from GNI a charge for the consumption of fixed capital (a calculation that yields net national income) and for the depletion of natural resources. The deduction for the depletion of natural resources, which covers net forest depletion, energy depletion, and mineral depletion, reflects the decline in asset values associated with the extraction and harvesting of natural resources. This is analogous to depreciation of fixed assets. Growth rates of adjusted net national income are computed from constant price series deflated using the gross national expenditure (formerly domestic absorption) deflator.

  description: A price index is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process. A measure of the change in the prices received by domestic producers for their outputs or of the change in the prices paid by domestic producers for their intermediate inputs. Therefore, basically, a price index illustrates how the price of a product or of a basket of products has changed since the base period. The base price of an index is 100 by agreement, meaning that, for instance, an index equal to 110 reflects an increase in the absolute price of 10% and an index equal to 95 a decrease of 5%.

  description: The water exploitation index (WEI+) provides a measure of total water consumption as a percentage of the renewable freshwater resources available for a given territory and period It quantifies how much water is abstracted and how much water is returned to the environment by economic sectors before or after use. The difference between water abstractions and water returns is regarded as 'water consumption'. In the absence of Europe-wide agreed formal targets, values above 20 % are generally considered to be a sign of water scarcity, while values equal or greater than 40 % indicate situations of severe water scarcity, meaning the use of freshwater resources is unsustainable. Annual calculations of the WEI+ at national level do not reflect uneven spatial and seasonal distribution of resources and may therefore mask water stress, which occurs on a seasonal or regional basis. The indicator is produced by the EEA based on modelling data from the WISE SoE-Water quantity database (WISE 3) and other open sources (Eurostat, OECD) and including gap filling methods.

  description: 'The livestock density index provides the number of livestock units (LSU) per hectare of utilised agricultural area. The LSU is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and ages. The LSU coefficients, which are at the basis of this indicator, are established by convention (originally, they were related to the animals'' feed requirements, the reference being a dairy cow with an annual yield of 3000 kg milk, without additional concentrated feedstuffs). In the interpretation of the livestock density index, the limits of this theoretical unit are to be taken into account. The livestock species aggregated in the LSU total, for the purpose of this indicator, are: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and rabbits. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Livestock_density_index: The livestock density index is an indicator for the pressure of livestock farming on the environment. Livestock, through manure production, contributes to climate change (greenhouse gas emissions) and nutrient leaching into water and air. A higher livestock density means that a higher amount of manure is available per ha of UAA, which increases the risk of nutrient leaching. The actual impact on the environment of livestock farming is not only depending on the amount of livestock, but also depends on farming practices. An increase in the livestock index, therefore does not necessarily needs to lead to environmental degradation.'

The erosion rate comprises the whole estimated erosion > 0 tonnes/hectare/year. The affected area considers only potentially erosive-prone land, meaning that artificial, sandy, rocky and icy surfaces as well as wetlands and water bodies are not included in the area on which the indicator is based. Data on soil erosion are published under agreement with the data provider - Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC - ISPRA). These data represent the soil erosion rates by water estimated on the basis of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) empirical computer model. Reference metadata: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/aei_pr_soiler_esms.htm Soil erosion (by water and wind) can be defined as the wearing away of the land surface by physical forces such as rainfall, flowing water, wind, ice, temperature change, gravity or other natural or anthropogenic agents that abrade, detach and remove soil or geological material from one point on the earth''s surface to be deposited elsewhere. When used in the context of pressures on soil, erosion refers to accelerated loss of soil as a result of anthropogenic activity, in excess of accepted rates of natural soil formation. The main factors affecting the rates of soil erosion by water are precipitation, soil type, topography, land use and land management. [...]'

  name: Plant genetic resources accessions stored ex situ
  description: 'Definition: The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium- or long-term conservation facilities (ex situ, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted. The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium- or long-term conditions, where an ''accession'' is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).

  name: Number of local breeds for which sufficient genetic resources are stored for reconstitution
  description: 'Definition: The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium- or long-term conservation facilities (ex situ in vito, i.e. in genebanks) represents trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides partial assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ/on-farm. The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted. The animal component is calculated as the number of local (i.e. being reported to exist only in one country) and transboundary (i.e. being reported to exist in more than one country) breeds with material stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material which is required to reconstitute the breed in case of extinction (further information on "sufficient material stored to reconstitute a breed" can be found in the Guidelines on Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf). Concepts: Breed: A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity.'

  description: This indicator measures the pressure on the renewable water resources of a country caused by irrigation. According to Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) agriculture accounts for more than 70 percent of freshwater drawn from lakes, rivers and underground sources. Most is used for irrigation which provides about 40 percent of the world food production. Poor management has resulted in the salinization of about 20 percent of the world's irrigated land, with an additional 1.5 million ha affected annually. Water withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of total renewable resources where extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable or where water reuse is significant. Withdrawals for agriculture and industry are total withdrawals for irrigation and livestock production and for direct industrial use (including for cooling thermoelectric plants).

The indicator is presented as indices relative to a baseline of 100 (see section 3.9). The Harmonised risk indicator is based on statistics on the quantity of active substances in plant protection products placed on the market under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, provided to Eurostat according to Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009. Those data are categorised into 4 risk groups and multiplied by hazard weightings established in Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782. The results of the calculations are then aggregated. The Member States and the Commission shall calculate and publish the Harmonised risk indicator in accordance with Articles 15(2) and 15(4) of Directive 2009/128/EC for each calendar year. The results of the calculations are available at the latest 20 months after the reference year. Eurostat calculates the EU-level indicator. Eurostat also calculates the national Harmonised risk indicator on behalf of Member States as a service. Member States make the information available to the public before 30 August each year.

  description: 'This data set contains data on the total consumption of inorganic (or mineral) fertilisers - in tonnes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) - reported by countries or estimated by Eurostat (data for some MS have been estimated in some cases up to 2018). Nutrients, such as N and P, are absorbed from the soil by plants, for their growth. They mainly come in the form of mineral - inorganic - fertilisers, which are widely used in agriculture to optimise production, and organic fertilisers such as manure. While N and P mineral fertilisers greatly enhance crop production, their excessive use may lead to losses of these nutrients to the environment, contributing to environmental pollution. N and P behave differently in terms of their availability for loss from the agricultural system. N is highly soluble with limited build-up in the soils, and research shows a positive relationship between application rate and nitrate loss from the soil root zone. P losses from land occur due to soil erosion and agricultural run-off. Historic over-fertilisation of P can build up soil P saturation, in which case even negligible new fertiliser inputs may increase pollution.

  description: Data are taken from well samples and aggregated to annual average concentrations for groundwater bodies in Europe. Nitrate can persist in groundwater for a long time and accumulate at a high level through inputs from anthropogenic sources (mainly agriculture). The EU drinking water standard is limited to 50 mg NO3/L to avoid threats to human health. The distribution of measured groundwater bodies might mask exceedance of nitrate levels in certain polluted areas.

National surveys in most countries indicate that the level of fruit and vegetable consumption in the WHO European Region is still poor (20), and all international and national authorities advise plentiful consumption of fruit and vegetables as part of healthy diets.

  description: Across the WHO European Region, children's sugar intake is too high, with children commonly consuming more than 10% of their daily calories from added sugars (21), and soft drinks are a major contributor. High intake of sugar-sweetened drinks is associated with a greater risk of weight gain and obesity (22,23) and has a detrimental impact on dental health (24).

  name: Prevalence of severe food insecurity in the total population (3-year average)
  description: The prevalence of severe food insecurity is an estimate of the percentage of people in the population who live in households classified as severely food insecure. The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify "severe" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item "having not eaten for an entire day" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to several of the most severe experiences described in the FIES questions, such as to have been forced to reduce the quantity of the food, to have skipped meals, having gone hungry, or having to go for a whole day without eating because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of lack of food access.

The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify "moderate or severe" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item "having to eat less" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low quality diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of lack of food access.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

  name: Income share held by lowest 20%
  description: Inequality in the distribution of income is reflected in the share of income or consumption accruing to a portion of the population ranked by income or consumption levels. The portions ranked lowest by personal income receive the smallest shares of total income. Data on the distribution of income or consumption come from nationally representative household surveys. Where the original data from the household survey were available, they have been used to directly calculate the income or consumption shares by quintile. Otherwise, shares have been estimated from the best available grouped data. The distribution data have been adjusted for household size, providing a more consistent measure of per capita income or consumption. The year reflects the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year data collection started. Percentage shares by quintile may not sum to 100 because of rounding.

  name: Proportion of people living below 50 percent of median income
  description: The percentage of people in the population who live in households whose per capita income or consumption is below half of the median income or consumption per capita. The median is measured at 2017 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the Poverty and Inequality Platform (http://www.pip.worldbank.org). For some countries, medians are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential data. The reference year is the year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year in which data were collected is reported.

  name: Coefficient of variation of habitual caloric consumption distribution (real number)
  description: For many countries, the coefficient of variation, taken as an indicator of the dispersion of the food consumption distribution within the general population, is derived from available household surveys that collect data on both food consumption/acquisition and income/expenditure. When appropriate data for directly estimating the variability of food consumption are not readily available, indirect procedures are used by FAO to estimate a suitable value for this parameter.

  name: Mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people)
  description: Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions are subscriptions to a public mobile telephone service that provide access to the PSTN using cellular technology. The indicator includes (and is split into) the number of postpaid subscriptions, and the number of active prepaid accounts (i.e. that have been used during the last three months). The indicator applies to all mobile cellular subscriptions that offer voice communications. It excludes subscriptions via data cards or USB modems, subscriptions to public mobile data services, private trunked mobile radio, telepoint, radio paging and telemetry services. Mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people) indicator is derived by all mobile subscriptions divided by the country's population and multiplied by 100.
