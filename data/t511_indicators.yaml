    Which Is Used To Remunerate Borrowed Or Rented Factors Of Production (Capital,
    Wages And Land Rents) As Well As Own Production Factors (Own Labour, Capital And
    Land). Annual Work Units (Awus) Are Defined As Full-Time Equivalent Employment
    (Corresponding To The Number Of Full-Time Equivalent Jobs), Which Is Calculated
    By Dividing Total Hours Worked By The Average Annual Number Of Hours Worked In
    Full-Time Jobs Within The Economic Territory. This Can Be Interpreted As A Measure
    Of Labour Productivity In Agriculture. The Data Stem From The Economic Accounts
    For Agriculture (Eaa), Which Provide Detailed Information On Agricultural Sector

    Soil Erosion (By Water And Wind) Can Be Defined As The Wearing Away Of The Land
    Surface By Physical Forces Such As Rainfall, Flowing Water, Wind, Ice, Temperature
    Change, Gravity Or Other Natural Or Anthropogenic Agents That Abrade, Detach And
    Remove Soil Or Geological Material From One Point On The Earth''S Surface To Be
    Deposited Elsewhere. When Used In The Context Of Pressures On Soil, Erosion Refers
    To Accelerated Loss Of Soil As A Result Of Anthropogenic Activity, In Excess Of
    Accepted Rates Of Natural Soil Formation. The Main Factors Affecting The Rates
    Of Soil Erosion By Water Are Precipitation, Soil Type, Topography, Land Use And
    Land Management. [...]'

    By Countries Or Estimated By Eurostat (Data For Some Ms Have Been Estimated In
    Some Cases Up To 2018). Nutrients, Such As N And P, Are Absorbed From The Soil
    By Plants, For Their Growth. They Mainly Come In The Form Of Mineral – Inorganic
    – Fertilisers, Which Are Widely Used In Agriculture To Optimise Production, And
    Organic Fertilisers Such As Manure. While N And P Mineral Fertilisers Greatly
    Enhance Crop Production, Their Excessive Use May Lead To Losses Of These Nutrients
    To The Environment, Contributing To Environmental Pollution. N And P Behave Differently
    In Terms Of Their Availability For Loss From The Agricultural System. N Is Highly
    Soluble With Limited Build-Up In The Soils, And Research Shows A Positive Relationship
    Between Application Rate And Nitrate Loss From The Soil Root Zone. P Losses From
    Land Occur Due To Soil Erosion And Agricultural Run-Off. Historic Over-Fertilisation
    Of P Can Build Up Soil P Saturation, In Which Case Even Negligible New Fertiliser
    Inputs May Increase Pollution. For Statistical Concepts And Definition, See The
