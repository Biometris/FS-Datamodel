  description: >-
    EDGAR-FOOD has been developed to aid the understanding of the activities
    underlying the energy demand and use, agriculture and land use change
    emissions associated with the production, distribution, consumption and
    disposal of food through the various stages and sectors of the composite
    global food system. These data were complemented with data from the FAOSTAT
    database on GHG emissions from land use related to agriculture (FAO, 2020).
    Details regarding the methodology applied are available in Crippa et al.
    (2021).
