  description: >-
    EDGAR-FOOD has been developed to aid the understanding of the activities
    underlying the energy demand and use, agriculture and land use change
    emissions associated with the production, distribution, consumption and
    disposal of food through the various stages and sectors of the composite
    global food system. These data were complemented with data from the FAOSTAT
    database on GHG emissions from land use related to agriculture (FAO, 2020).
    Details regarding the methodology applied are available in Crippa et al.
    (2021). Further info also in https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edgar_food

  justification: >-
    It includes the full food-system, the methodology is robust, and it covers
    all possible degrees of temporal and spatial granularity levels (which were
    the main gaps identified in the first phase of the project). Uncertainties
    are also estimated, which are an extra advantage of this indicator in
    comparison with the others included in the F2F monitoring framework.
    Negative direction is desirable.
