The indicator is assessed through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES).

It is obtained by deducting compensation of employees, rent and net interest from agricultural factor income. For the purpose of this indicator, compensation of employees are added back in, so that the resulting indicator represents the compensation of all work (salaried and non-salaried) performed in the agricultural sector, as well as the income remaining with the enterprise. economic fair economic viability in the food value chain income distribution primary food production Water exploitation index, plus (WEI+) kt CO2eq Water use in agriculture assessed with the Water Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+), which provides an estimated measure of the total water use as a percentage of the renewable freshwater resources (groundwater and surface water) for a given territory and time period. It helps track the efficiency of water utilization in agricultural practices. As advanced version of the WEI, the WEI+ addresses regional and seasonal aspects of water scarcity. In addition, it also takes water use (water abstraction minus water returned) into account. It identifies areas prone to water stress due to exceeding water abstraction and use on a seasonal scale in relation to the resources available. environmental sustainable use of resources water primary food production Gross nutrient balance - nitrogen kg/ha Nitrogen is added to the soil by mineral and organic fertilisers, grazing animals, atmospheric deposition and biological nitrogen fixation, while harvesting of crops, grazing and removal of residues remove nitrogen from the soil. A lack of nitrogen may cause degradation in soil fertility and erosion, while an excess may cause surface and groundwater (including drinking water) pollution and eutrophication. This indicator also helps identifying the factors which contribute to the nitrogen surplus and shows the change over time. environmental sustainable use of resources land and soil primary food production Use of the more hazardous pesticides Index 2015-2017 average = 100 The indicator is calculated by adding together the quantities of active substances (categorised into Group 3 of Directive 2009/128/EC).
