Annual work units (AWUs) are defined as full-time equivalent employment (corresponding to the number of full-time equivalent jobs), which is calculated by dividing total hours worked by the average annual number of hours worked in full-time jobs within the economic territory.

The agricultural income aggregates do not represent the disposable income of farm households, because the latter, in addition to their purely agricultural incomes, may also have income from other sources (non-agricultural activities, remuneration, social benefits, income from property). Comparing agricultural income to average wages in the economy nonetheless provides an estimate for the opportunity cost of agricultural family labour, i.e., the average income opportunities that a person would have outside of agriculture. The Agricultural entrepreneurial income can be negative (in SK e.g.). In this case the share is not calculated.

GDP measures the value of total final output of goods and services produced by an economy within a certain period of time. It includes goods and services that have markets (or which could have markets) and products which are produced by general government and non-profit institutions. It is a measure of economic activity and is also used as a proxy for the development in a country\u2019s material living standards. However, it is a limited measure of economic welfare. For example, neither does GDP include most unpaid household work nor does GDP take account of negative effects of economic activity, like environmental degradation. primary food production transport food processing retail economy Competitiveness Balance of trade Million euros The International trade balance indicator is the difference between exports and imports of goods. Exports of goods record flows from an EA/EU Member State to a non-EA/EU country while imports record inwards flows.

It is defined as the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption. GVA is valued at basic prices and intermediate consumption is valued at purchasers\u2019 prices. Justification of selection: GVA provides valuable insights into the sector's sustainability and alignment with green economy objectives, making it a crucial metric for driving sustainable practices and policies. In general, growing value added can indicate higher productivity and efficiency of production. Currently, we can only show data for the primary sectors and the food processing sectors. Other sectors will be incorporated in the future. With a complete dataset, this indicator can provide valuable insights on the share of value added that is captured at each step of the supply chain. Monitored over time, it can assess progress towards the transition to a sustainable food system. primary food production transport food processing retail economy Competitiveness Products under EU quality schemes (per scheme: PDO, PGI, TSG, GI) Number of products PDO = Protected Designation of Origin PGI = Protected Geographical Indication TSG = Traditional Speciality Guaranteed GI = Geographical Indication The Focus Area 3A of Rural Development Programmes is improving competitiveness of primary producers by better integrating them into the agri-food chain. https://agridata.ec.europa.eu/Qlik_Downloads/Adding-Value-sources.htm primary food production food processing economy Food affordability Adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita Purchasing power standard (PPS, EU27 from 2020), per inhabitant The adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita in PPS is calculated as the adjusted gross disposable income of households and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) divided by the purchasing power parities (PPP) of the actual individual consumption of households and by the total resident population. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are indicators of price level differences across countries. PPPs tell us how many currency units a given quantity of goods and services costs in different countries. PPPs can thus be used as currency conversion rates to convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS), eliminating the effect of price level differences across countries. The main use of PPPs is to convert national accounts aggregates into comparable volume aggregates. Applying nominal exchange rates in this process would overestimate the disposable income of countries with high price levels relative to countries with low price levels. The use of PPPs ensures that the adjusted disposable of all countries is valued at a uniform price level and thus reflects only differences in the actual volume of the economy. -&gt; From \"Reference metadata\": https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tec00113_esmsip2.htm consumption retail economy Food affordability Consumer Prices, Food Indices (2015 = 100) Index number of Food CPI The Food CPI measures the change over time in the general level of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverage items that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. This is done by measuring the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of consumer food and beverage of constant quality and similar characteristics, with the products in the basket being selected to be representative of households\u2019 expenditure during a specified period. consumption retail economy Food affordability Food price inflation % Not available consumption retail economy Food affordability Cost of a healthy diet (CoHD), PPP dollar per person per day international dollars per person per day (using PPP) The cost of a healthy diet indicator is the cost of purchasing the least expensive locally available foods to meet requirements for energy and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), for a representative person within energy balance at 2 330 kcal/day. The cost of a healthy diet is converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). consumption retail economy Food affordability Prevalence of unaffordability (PUA) % The indicator estimates the percentage of individuals in a population whose disposable income, net of the amount needed to acquire all basic non-food goods and services, is lower than the least-cost healthy diet. A cost threshold (r) is obtained by summing the cost of a healthy diet (CoHD) with the cost of basic non-food goods and services (n). The PUA indicator is obtained by contrasting the threshold r against country-specific income distribution data that are provided by the World Bank\u2019s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). consumption retail economy Food affordability Number of people unable to afford a healthy diet (NUA) million people The indicator estimates the total number of people who are unable to afford a healthy diet. The NUA indicator is computed by multiplying PUA by the reference population size taken from the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects. consumption retail economy Food affordability Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (IFPA), by Food CPI Consumer Price Index (CPI) The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period. primary food production consumption food processing retail economy Food affordability Inflation, consumer prices (annual %) % per year Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly. The Laspeyres formula is generally used. consumption retail economy Food affordability Adjusted net national income per capita (constant 2015 US$) constant 2015 US$; weighted average Adjusted net national income complements gross national income (GNI) in assessing economic progress (Hamilton and Ley 2010) by providing a broader measure of national income that accounts for the depletion of natural resources. Adjusted net national income is calculated by subtracting from GNI a charge for the consumption of fixed capital (a calculation that yields net national income) and for the depletion of natural resources. The deduction for the depletion of natural resources, which covers net forest depletion, energy depletion, and mineral depletion, reflects the decline in asset values associated with the extraction and harvesting of natural resources. This is analogous to depreciation of fixed assets. Growth rates of adjusted net national income are computed from constant price series deflated using the gross national expenditure (formerly domestic absorption) deflator. consumption retail economy Food affordability Change of consumer food prices % (annual percentage change by month) Reference metadata: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/prc_fsc_idx_esms.htm#shortstat_conc_defDisseminated Also see the metadata provided by the JRC EU Food System Monitoring Dashboard for the indicator \"Consumer food inflation\": https://datam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datam/mashup/EU_FOOD_SYSTEM_MONITORING/index.html consumption retail economy Food affordability Price indices of the means of agricultural production, input Index, 2015=100 A price index is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process. A measure of the change in the prices received by domestic producers for their outputs or of the change in the prices paid by domestic producers for their intermediate inputs. Therefore, basically, a price index illustrates how the price of a product or of a basket of products has changed since the base period. The base price of an index is 100 by agreement, meaning that, for instance, an index equal to 110 reflects an increase in the absolute price of 10% and an index equal to 95 a decrease of 5%. primary food production economy Food affordability Household final consumption expenditure by purpose: Share of food expenditure % of total See the information provided by the JRC EU Food System Monitoring Dashboard for the indicator \"Share of household spending on food\". https://datam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datam/mashup/EU_FOOD_SYSTEM_MONITORING/index.html consumption economy Food affordability Affordability of a healthy diet: ratio of cost to food expenditures Ratio The ratio of the cost of a healthy diet to total food expenditure per capita per day from national accounts.

This area is expressed in km2 and as a percentage of the total non-artificial, erodible area in the country. Where there is no land that is at risk of soil erosion by water of more than 10 tonnes per hectare, a country will have a zero value. Soil erosion may still be occurring in areas of those countries, but at a rate of less than 10 tonnes per hectare.

The difference between water abstractions and water returns is regarded as \u2018water consumption\u2019. In the absence of Europe-wide agreed formal targets, values above 20 % are generally considered to be a sign of water scarcity, while values equal or greater than 40 % indicate situations of severe water scarcity, meaning the use of freshwater resources is unsustainable. Annual calculations of the WEI+ at national level do not reflect uneven spatial and seasonal distribution of resources and may therefore mask water stress, which occurs on a seasonal or regional basis.

The LSU is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and ages. The LSU coefficients, which are at the basis of this indicator, are established by convention (originally, they were related to the animals' feed requirements, the reference being a dairy cow with an annual yield of 3000 kg milk, without additional concentrated feedstuffs). In the interpretation of the livestock density index, the limits of this theoretical unit are to be taken into account. The livestock species aggregated in the LSU total, for the purpose of this indicator, are: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and rabbits. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Livestock_density_index: The livestock density index is an indicator for the pressure of livestock farming on the environment. Livestock, through manure production, contributes to climate change (greenhouse gas emissions) and nutrient leaching into water and air. A higher livestock density means that a higher amount of manure is available per ha of UAA, which increases the risk of nutrient leaching. The actual impact on the environment of livestock farming is not only depending on the amount of livestock, but also depends on farming practices. An increase in the livestock index, therefore does not necessarily needs to lead to environmental degradation. primary food production environment Conserv. of natural resources Estimated soil loss by water erosion by land cover type Tonnes per hectare per year Soil erosion by water is one of the most widespread forms of soil degradation in Europe. The indicator soil erosion estimates the soil loss by water erosion processes (rain splash, sheetwash and rills) for different land cover types which are based on the Corine Land Cover nomenclature: Agricultural areas and natural grassland, split in the latter two land cover types: i) Agricultural areas excluding pastures ii) Pastures and natural grassland The figures of the affected area are represented in tonnes per hectares per year. The erosion rate comprises the whole estimated erosion &gt; 0 tonnes/hectare/year. The affected area considers only potentially erosive-prone land, meaning that artificial, sandy, rocky and icy surfaces as well as wetlands and water bodies are not included in the area on which the indicator is based. Data on soil erosion are published under agreement with the data provider \u2013 Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC \u2013 ISPRA). These data represent the soil erosion rates by water estimated on the basis of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) empirical computer model.

Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted. The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium- or long-term conditions, where an \u2018accession\u2019 is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank.

Concepts: Breed: A breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. primary food production environment Conserv. of natural resources Annual freshwater withdrawals, agriculture (% of total freshwater withdrawal) % of total freshwater withdrawal This indicator measures the pressure on the renewable water resources of a country caused by irrigation. According to Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) agriculture accounts for more than 70 percent of freshwater drawn from lakes, rivers and underground sources. Most is used for irrigation which provides about 40 percent of the world food production. Poor management has resulted in the salinization of about 20 percent of the world's irrigated land, with an additional 1.5 million ha affected annually. Water withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of total renewable resources where extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable or where water reuse is significant. Withdrawals for agriculture and industry are total withdrawals for irrigation and livestock production and for direct industrial use (including for cooling thermoelectric plants). primary food production environment Biodiversity conservation Common farmland bird index Index, 2000=100 Up to reference year 2014, the unsmoothed national farmland bird indices were provided to Eurostat by the national BirdLife organisations based on an agreed national list of species (see the annexed \"National lists of farmland bird species lists as of 2014\"). Note that only one species, the skylark Alauda arvensis, is common to all the national lists of farmland birds. Starting from reference year 2015, these indices are collected from the EU Member States by the OECD, whether or not they are members of OECD. primary food production environment Biodiversity conservation Investments related to biodiversity % Share of farms benefitting from CAP investment support contributing to biodiversity environment Organic farming Area under organic farming (sdg_02_40) % of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) The indicator measures the share of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) occupied by organic farming (existing organically-farmed areas and areas in process of conversion). Farming is recognised to be organic if it complies with Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which has set up a comprehensive framework for the organic production of crops and livestock and for the labelling, processing and marketing of organic products, as well as for governing imports of organic products into the EU.

The use of pesticides entails risks and impacts on human health and the environment. The indicator is based on the quantities of chemical active substances contained in the pesticides which are placed on the market (sold), and therefore used, in each Member State, and the hazard properties of these active substances. The data are presented as an index relative to the average results for the period 2015 to 2017. primary food production environment Pesticide and antibiotic use Sales of pesticides by type of pesticide Active substances in kilograms (kg) (Both, agricultural and non-agricultural uses of plant production products are covered) Volume of pesticides sold in the Member States. This data collection comprises pesticide sales data in EU27 (from 2020) and EFTA (Switzerland and Norway) based on the term \"placing on the market\" as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. primary food production environment Pesticide and antibiotic use Harmonised risk indicator 1 for pesticides by categorisation of active substances Index, 2011-2013 average = 100 (Index relattive to a baseline of 100) Harmonised risk indicators are established in order to measure the progress achieved in meeting the objectives of the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. The data set shows the values of the Harmonised risk indicator 1 (HRI 1 - hereafter referred to as \u2018the Harmonised risk indicator\u2019), established in Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782 of 15 May 2019, amending Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the establishment of harmonised risk indicators. The indicator is presented as indices relative to a baseline of 100 (see section 3.9). The Harmonised risk indicator is based on statistics on the quantity of active substances in plant protection products placed on the market under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, provided to Eurostat according to Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009. Those data are categorised into 4 risk groups and multiplied by hazard weightings established in Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782. The results of the calculations are then aggregated. The Member States and the Commission shall calculate and publish the Harmonised risk indicator in accordance with Articles 15(2) and 15(4) of Directive 2009/128/EC for each calendar year. The results of the calculations are available at the latest 20 months after the reference year. Eurostat calculates the EU-level indicator. Eurostat also calculates the national Harmonised risk indicator on behalf of Member States as a service. Member States make the information available to the public before 30 August each year.

Nutrients, such as N and P, are absorbed from the soil by plants, for their growth. They mainly come in the form of mineral \u2013 inorganic \u2013 fertilisers, which are widely used in agriculture to optimise production, and organic fertilisers such as manure. While N and P mineral fertilisers greatly enhance crop production, their excessive use may lead to losses of these nutrients to the environment, contributing to environmental pollution. N and P behave differently in terms of their availability for loss from the agricultural system. N is highly soluble with limited build-up in the soils, and research shows a positive relationship between application rate and nitrate loss from the soil root zone. P losses from land occur due to soil erosion and agricultural run-off. Historic over-fertilisation of P can build up soil P saturation, in which case even negligible new fertiliser inputs may increase pollution.

Fertilizer products cover nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers (including ground rock phosphate). Traditional nutrients--animal and plant manures--are not included. For the purpose of data dissemination, FAO has adopted the concept of a calendar year (January to December). Some countries compile fertilizer data on a calendar year basis, while others are on a split-year basis. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. primary food production environment Fertilizer use Gross nutrient balance per hectare UAA - Nitrogen kg/ha The GNB is calculated as the balance between inputs and outputs of nutrients to the agricultural soil: The inputs are: Consumption of fertilisers, Gross input of manure, and Other inputs The outputs are: Removal of nutrients with the harvest of crops, Removal of nutrients through the harvest and grazing of fodder, and Crop residues removed from the field. primary food production environment Fertilizer use Gross nutrient balance per hectare UAA - Phosphorus kg/ha The GNB is calculated as the balance between inputs and outputs of nutrients to the agricultural soil: The inputs are: Consumption of fertilisers, Gross input of manure, and Other inputs The outputs are: Removal of nutrients with the harvest of crops, Removal of nutrients through the harvest and grazing of fodder, and Crop residues removed from the field. primary food production environment Impacts of climate change Drought impact area on ecosystems (sdg_15_42) km2 area affected % of total area This indicator shows the area impacted by drought in [km2] and [% of the total area of the country]. It monitors negative anomalies in vegetation productivity in areas with a severe soil moisture deficit during the growing season (more than one standard deviation from the long term average - observed through remote sensing data at 500\u00d7500 metres resolution of the Copernicus EMS European Drought Observatory of the European Commission Joint Research Centre). The indicator covers only agricultural droughts with soil moisture deficits causing reduced vegetation productivity due to insufficient precipitation, as opposed to hydrological droughts, which occur when low water supplies become apparent in streams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels, usually after many months of meteorological drought. primary food production environment Animal keeping Livestock units per agricultural land area (major livestock types) LSU/ha None primary food production environment Animal keeping Livestock production index Index (2014-2016 = 100) None primary food production environment Animal keeping Share of laying hens by way of keeping (Enriched cage, Free range, Barn, Organic) Share of reported way of keeping in total (in %) None primary food production environment Food waste &amp; food loss Food waste and food waste prevention by NACE Rev. 2 activity Kilogram per capita / Tonnes of fresh mass According to Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC), article 3, point 4a, \"food waste means all food as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council that has become waste\"; in simple words, food waste is any food and inedible parts of food, that has entered in the food supply chain, that then has been removed or discarded from the food supply chain or at the final consumption stage, that is finally destined to be processed as waste, either separately collected as food waste or collected in municipal waste; moreover, food waste is any food, and inedible parts of food, removed from the food supply chain to be recovered or disposed Commission delegated decision (EU) 2019/1597 summarises in point 3 of the recital that food waste does not include losses at stages of the food supply chain where certain products have not yet become food.

The indicator can be used to illustrate geographical variations in current concentrations and temporal trends. Large inputs of nitrogen to water bodies from urban areas, industry, and agricultural areas, can have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. The data stem from the EEA Waterbase database on the status and quality of Europe's rivers. primary food production health Food quality &amp; safety Percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services % The percentage of people using drinking water from an improved source that is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination.

The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population. consumption retail health Malnutrition Percentage of children under 5 years of age who are stunted (modelled estimates) % Percentage of stunting (height-for-age less than -2 standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards median) among children aged 0-59 months. consumption retail health Food access Prevalence of severe food insecurity in the total population (3-year average) % The prevalence of severe food insecurity is an estimate of the percentage of people in the population who live in households classified as severely food insecure. The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify \"severe\" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item \"having not eaten for an entire day\" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to several of the most severe experiences described in the FIES questions, such as to have been forced to reduce the quantity of the food, to have skipped meals, having gone hungry, or having to go for a whole day without eating because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of lack of food access. consumption health Food access Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the total population (3-year average) % The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity is an estimate of the percentage of people in the population who live in households classified as moderately or severely food insecure. The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify \"moderate or severe\" food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item \"having to eat less\" on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low quality diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of lack of food access. consumption health Food access Gross domestic product per capita, PPP, (constant 2017 international $) Int$/cap GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2011 international dollars. consumption health Food access Rail lines density (total route in km per 100 square km of land area) km Rail lines density corresponds to the ratio between the length of railway route available for train service, irrespective of the number of parallel tracks (rail lines, total route in km) with the area of the country. consumption health Food access Proportion of agricultural land area that has achieved an acceptable or desirable level of food security % see metadata (section 2.4.1): https://files-faostat.fao.org/production/SDGB/Metadata.xlsx primary food production health Food availability Average dietary energy supply adequacy (3-year average) % The indicator expresses the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) as a percentage of the Average Dietary Energy Requirement (ADER).

Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, including natural and cultivated crops. primary food production health Food availability Food production index 2014-2016 = 100 Food production index covers food crops that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content. consumption health Food availability Protein supply quantity of animal products g/capita/day Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Persons are counted only once even if they are affected by more than one of these phenomena. \u2022 Persons are considered to be at risk of poverty after social transfers, if they have an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income. \u2022 Severely materially or socially deprived persons have living conditions severely constrained by a lack of resources, they experience at least 7 out of 13 following deprivations items: cannot afford i) to pay rent or utility bills, ii) keep home adequately warm, iii) face unexpected expenses, iv) eat meat, fish or a protein equivalent every second day, v) a week holiday away from home, vi) have access to a car/van for personal use; vii) replace worn out furniture; viii) replace worn-out clothes with some new ones; ix) have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; x) spend a small amount of money each week on him/herself (\"pocket money\"); xi) have regular leisure activities; xii) get together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month; and xiii) have an internet connection. \u2022 People living in households with very low work intensity are those aged 0-64 living in households where the adults (aged 18-64) work 20 % or less of their total work potential during the past year. In order to measure child poverty, the indicator is available for the age group 0-17. consumption society Income distribut._Poverty risk Income Equality/Income distribution Gini index Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. consumption society Income distribut._Poverty risk Persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion by degree of urbanisation (sdg_01_10a) (broken down by Cities, Towns and suburbs and Rural areas) % of population This indicator corresponds to the sum of persons who are: at risk of poverty after social transfers, severely materially or socially deprived or living in households with very low work intensity. Persons are counted only once even if they are affected by more than one of these phenomena. The data is presented by degree of urbanisation. Based on the share of local population living in urban clusters and in urban centres, this typology classifies Local Administrative Units (LAU or communes) into three types of area: \u2022 Cities (densely populated areas) \u2022 Towns and suburbs (intermediate density areas) \u2022 Rural areas (thinly populated areas). consumption society Income distribut._Poverty risk Income share held by lowest 20% % (percentage share of income) Inequality in the distribution of income is reflected in the share of income or consumption accruing to a portion of the population ranked by income or consumption levels. The portions ranked lowest by personal income receive the smallest shares of total income. Data on the distribution of income or consumption come from nationally representative household surveys. Where the original data from the household survey were available, they have been used to directly calculate the income or consumption shares by quintile. Otherwise, shares have been estimated from the best available grouped data. The distribution data have been adjusted for household size, providing a more consistent measure of per capita income or consumption. The year reflects the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year data collection started.

Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are indicators of price level differences across countries. PPPs tell us how many currency units a given quantity of goods and services costs in different countries. PPPs can thus be used as currency conversion rates to convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency, the purchasing power standard (PPS), eliminating the effect of price level differences across countries. The main use of PPPs is to convert national accounts aggregates into comparable volume aggregates. Applying nominal exchange rates in this process would overestimate the disposable income of countries with high price levels relative to countries with low price levels. The use of PPPs ensures that the adjusted disposable of all countries is valued at a uniform price level and thus reflects only differences in the actual volume of the economy. -&gt; From \"Reference metadata\": https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tec00113_esmsip2.htm</p> <p>Dimension: economy</p> <p>Category: FoodAffordability</p> <p>Unit of measurement: Purchasing power standard (PPS, EU27 from 2020), per inhabitant</p>"},{"location":"indicators/AdjustedNetNationalIncomePerCapitaConstant2015Us/","title":"Adjusted net national income per capita (constant 2015 US$)","text":"<p>Adjusted net national income complements gross national income (GNI) in assessing economic progress (Hamilton and Ley 2010) by providing a broader measure of national income that accounts for the depletion of natural resources.

They mainly come in the form of mineral \u2013 inorganic \u2013 fertilisers, which are widely used in agriculture to optimise production, and organic fertilisers such as manure. While N and P mineral fertilisers greatly enhance crop production, their excessive use may lead to losses of these nutrients to the environment, contributing to environmental pollution. N and P behave differently in terms of their availability for loss from the agricultural system. N is highly soluble with limited build-up in the soils, and research shows a positive relationship between application rate and nitrate loss from the soil root zone. P losses from land occur due to soil erosion and agricultural run-off. Historic over-fertilisation of P can build up soil P saturation, in which case even negligible new fertiliser inputs may increase pollution.
